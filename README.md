# Emotxt
- Messenger service which allows emotional tone to be applied to messages and text-to-speech functionality.

EmoTxt (Emotional Text) is a messaging app that seeks to improve the messaging experience by applying emotional analysis on text via machine learning and return an tone-based message accordingly. The need for this technology is because people often misinterpret ambiguous messages of text due to the tone of the author being unclear. This technology will surround a core messenger application where an user can have friends, be attached to message boards, and even send direct messages to other people.
